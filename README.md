# SigProfilerPlotting
SigProfilerPlotting provides a standard tool for displaying all types of mutational signatures as well as all types of mutational patterns in cancer genomes. The tool seamlessly integrates with other SigProfiler tools.

**INTRODUCTION**

The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for using the SigProfilerPlotting framework and associated functions/tools to visualize the output from SigProfilerExtraction and SigProfilerSimulator. An extensive Wiki page detailing the usage of this tool can be found at https://osf.io/2aj6t/wiki/home.

For users that prefer working in an R environment, a wrapper package is provided and can be found and installed from: https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/SigProfilerPlottingR

**PREREQUISITES**

The framework is written in PYTHON, however, it also requires the following software with the given versions (or newer):

  * PYTHON          version 3.4 or newer
  * SigProfilerMatrixGenerator (recommended)

**QUICK START GUIDE**

This section will guide you through the minimum steps required to plot mutational matrices:
1. Install the python package using pip:
```
                          pip install SigProfilerPlotting
```

2. From within a python session, you can now plot your mutational matrices as follows:
 ```python
$ python3
>> import sigProfilerPlotting as sigPlt
>> sigPlt.plotSBS(matrix_path, output_path, project, plot_type, percentage=False)
 ```
 The available functions are listed below and the layout of the required parameters are as follows:

      sigPlt.plotSBS(matrix_path, output_path, project, plot_type)

where matrix_path, output_path, project, and plot_type must be strings (surrounded by quotation marks, ex: "/Users/ebergstr/Desktop/test_sample").   

 3. The final plots are saved into the user-provided output folder.

## Single Base Substitution, Double Base Substitution, and Indel Plotting ##

**AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS**

```python
import sigProfilerPlotting as sigPlt

sigPlt.plotSBS(matrix_path, output_path, project, plot_type, percentage=False)
sigPlt.plotDBS(matrix_path, output_path, project, plot_type, percentage=False)
sigPlt.plotID(matrix_path, output_path, project, plot_type, percentage=False)

```

## Copy Number and Structural Variant Plotting ##

```python
import sigProfilerPlotting as sigPlt

matrix_path = "./sigProfilerPlotting/examples/input/breast_cancer_samples_example.CNV48.all" #Output of CNVMatrixGenerator
output_path = "./sigProfilerPlotting/examples/output/"
project = "Breast"
```

**AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS**

*Multi-page pdf of CNV or SV signatures*

```python
sigPlt.plotCNV(matrix_path, output_path, project, percentage=True, aggregate=False) #plotting of CNV signatures
sigPlt.plotSV(matrix_path, output_path, project, percentage=True, aggregate=False) #plotting of SV signatures

```
*Multi-page pdf of CNV or SV counts*

```python
sigPlt.plotCNV(matrix_path, output_path, project, percentage=False, aggregate=False) #plotting of CNV counts
sigPlt.plotSV(matrix_path, output_path, project,percentage=False, aggregate=False) #plotting of SV counts
```

*Single pdf of CNV or SV counts per sample for a given cancer type/project*

```python
sigPlt.plotCNV(matrix_path, output_path, project, percentage=False, aggregate=True) #plotting of CNV counts
sigPlt.plotSV(matrix_path, output_path, project, percentage, aggregate=True) #plotting of SV counts
```

matrix_path -> path to the mutational matrix of interest

output_path -> desired output path

project -> name of unique sample set

plot_type -> context of the mutational matrix (96, 192, 78, 94, etc.)

percentage -> Boolean: plot the mutational matrix as percentages of the sample's total mutation count. Default is False

To create a sample portrait, ensure that you have a matrix for all required contexts (SBS-6, SBS-24, SBS-96, SBS-384, SBS-1536, DBS-78, DBS-312, ID-83, ID-28, ID-96)

```python
from sigProfilerPlotting import sample_portrait as sP
sP.samplePortrait(sample_matrices_path, output_path, project, percentage=False)
```

**EXAMPLE**

This package comes with an example test for each plot type. Run the script plot_example.py from within the examples directory in the downloaded repo after installation:
```python
python3 sigProfilerPlotting/examples/plot_example.py
```

This example will create plots for each context for each of the included four samples. These plots will be saved within the `sigProfilerPlotting/examples/output/` folder.
